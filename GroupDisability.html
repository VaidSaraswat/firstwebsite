				<h2>Short Term Disability Insurance</h2>

		<section class="section">
			<p>
				Short Term Disability protection (STD) is designed to provide immediate income replacement benefits to employees unable to work due to an injury or illness. Short Term Disability benefits are typically payable for 4 – 6 months, coinciding with Long Term Disability waiting periods. It is often an employer paid benefit and, as a result, is usually taxable in the hands of the disabled employee. The benefit replaces a percentage of the employee’s weekly earnings up to a specified maximum. Once the end of the coverage period has been reached, an employee would be transitioned to Long Term Disability coverage as long as they continue to meet the definition of total disability.
			</p>

			<p>With Short Term Disability coverage in place, employers are able to apply for an Employment Insurance (EI) premium reduction.

				<h2>Long Term Disability Insurance</h2>

		</div>
		<section class="section">
			<p>
				Group Long Term Disability coverage (LTD) provides plan members with replacement income in the event of a disability caused by an illness or accident occurring on or off the job. If a plan member is unable to work due to a disability, a percentage of income is payable monthly following the elimination period. These monthly income replacement benefits allow a plan member to provide for the basic necessities and maintain their standard of living.
			</p>

			<p>
				The amount of coverage available is typically expressed as a percentage of monthly earnings (i.e. 67%). Coverage is guaranteed medically up to a certain threshold, referred to as a Non-Evidence Maximum (NEM). Additional protection is often available on an optional basis up to a specified overall maximum, with proof of medical insurability.
			</p>

			<p>
				In addition to coverage maximums, plan design features include elimination periods, benefit periods, definitions of disability, taxation of benefits and optional benefits. Let us help you make sense of the options available and design the ideal LTD program for your business.

		<section class="section">
			<p>
				Claims management services and employee assistance benefits are commonly included in your Group Insurance Plan when LTD is selected. These programs are designed to assist companies dealing with an employee on disability claim and to help a disabled employee return to work in a timely manner.

				<h2>Supplemental Coverage</h2>
			</div>
		</div>

		<section class="section">
			<p>
				As a business owner or high income earner, your disability insurance needs are unique.  An individual disability insurance policy can supplement your group LTD benefits by providing access to higher coverage amounts and options that allow for a higher degree of customization.
			</p>

			<p>
				See Individual Disability Insurance for more details on supplementing your disability benefits.
