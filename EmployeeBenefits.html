				<h2> Put more in an employees' pockets with a group benefits plan</h2>
			</div>
		</div>

		<div class="row">
			<div class="column">
				<p class="content">
					For most entrepreneurs, running their own business
					can be a personally satisfying experience, but not
					without its challenges. Small business owners, in
					particular, worry about attracting the talent they need
					to succeed, as experienced people are hard to find
					and entice away from bigger companies. Offering the
					same perks can be a stretch for many small business
					owners who grapple with tight budget constraints.
				</p>

				<h3>What about existing employees?</h3>
				<p class="content">
					Keeping them happy is also a priority, but the
					question is, how? Many employers use salary
					increases to compensate employees for a job well
					done but are there any other options to reward
					strong performance? A group benefits plan may
					be the answer.
				</p>

				<h3>A tax-effective way to compensate employees</h3>
				<p class="content">
					For the employee, a salary increase is impacted
					up-front by a variety of payroll taxes and employee
					income taxes. However, with a group benefits plan,
					employees in all provinces except Quebec receive
					health and dental benefits tax-free and employer
					contributions are deductible as a business expense.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div class="column">
				<h3>The hidden costs</h3>
				<p class="content">
					To give an employee $1,000 more in salary, the
					employer must also factor in payroll taxes such as:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span>Canada Pension Plan/Quebec Pension Plan
						(CPP/QPP)</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Employment Insurance (EI)</span>
					</li>
					<li>
						<span>Workers’ Compensation</span>
					</li>

					<li>
						<span>Employer Health Tax (Ontario)</span>
					</li>

					<li>
						<span>and others.</span>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p class="content">
					In addition, the employee has to contribute their
					portion of some of the payroll taxes, such as
					CPP/QPP and EI.
				</p>

				<h3>Get more out of each
				compensation dollar</h3>

				<p class="content">
					As an alternative to an increase in salary, the employer
					could put that $1,000 towards the premium for a
					health and dental insurance plan and all of the
					$1,000 goes to the plan – to the benefit of the
					employee. Provincial sales tax* and premium tax are
					charged on the plan’s premiums, but this tax burden
					is still less than the payroll taxes charged on salary.
				</p>

				<p class="content">
					*Provincial sales tax only applicable in Ontario and Quebec.
				</p>
			</div>
		</div>
		<div class="section">
			<h3>Points to consider:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li> <span> In Ontario and Quebec, the employer's cost of insurance would be impacted by provincial sales tax.</span></li>
				<li> <span> The cost of health insurance includes carrier administration expenses and fees. </span></li>
				<li> <span> The above example is for a health and dental plan. Employer contributions to a life plan are a taxable benefit
				to the employee, and benefits from an LTD plan are only tax-free if fully funded by the employee. </span></li>
				<li> <span> Individual tax rates vary by income and province. </span></li>
				<li> <span> Applicable payroll taxes vary by province, and some such as CPP and EI have maximum contribution levels. </span></li>
				<li> <span> In Quebec, tax savings from a benefits plan would be on the federal tax portion, since health plans are taxable
				benefits for Quebec provincial income tax. </span></li>
				<li> <span> Depending on the situation, the employer may choose to consult with their tax advisor for additional information. </span></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Employees appreciate their benefit plans</h3>
			<p>Not only is a group benefits plan a tax-effective use of compensation dollars, employee satisfaction with their plans
				is very high. According to the 2011 sanofi-aventis Healthcare Survey, if given a choice, 59% of respondents would
			keep their health benefits rather than receive an extra $10,000 cash payment per year.</p>
